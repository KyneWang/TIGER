### Datasets: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cjJyrEFmxc7tXFansm_oMC12NijHmpuz?usp=sharing)
Please download the KG datasets and put into 'data/'.
Initializing the dataset on the first run may take a while.

We also provide varying sized datasets utilized in our scalability studies.

### Running Example:
python main.py --data_path data/conceptNet/ --task_mode inductive --model_name redgnn

Detailed Instructions are coming soon!
